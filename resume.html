            }</style>
            <li> Web-Based Tomato Leaf Disease Detection with CNN and Flask - </li>
        <p>We have presented "Web-Based Tomato Leaf Disease Detection with CNN and Flask" a 
approach for tomato leaf disease detection using convolutional neural networks (CNN). We trained 
a deep learning model using a dataset of tomato leaf images, which was collected from various 
sources. The trained model was able to accurately detect the presence of four common tomato leaf 
diseases, namely, bacterial spot, leaf mold, curl virus, healthy. We have successfully achieved 
99.85% of accuracy from our project work.</p>

        
        <li> Performance assessment of Parabolic Trough Collector using twisted reciever tube -</li>
        <p> A new receiver tube is designed to assess the robustness and adaptability of the selected tube
pattern to varying environmental conditions, such as solar irradiance, ambient temperature ﬂuctuations, thermal eﬃciency and heat 
transfer characteristics of the twisted tube.</p>

controller and have developed logics as per approved documents and P& ID, worked with control 
builder and CB tool for blocks creation and logics development according to the clients 
requirements.</p>
<li> Internship training program on Industrial Automation - </li>

<p>During my internship period at VTU Bosch Rexroth Center Of Competence in Automation
Technology, Mysuru, I had an opportunity to work and learn on the relays, PLC, sensors and 
hydraulics. During last week into training, we were able to integrate relays, PLC, sensors into 
hydraulics to perform an extension and retraction stroke.</p>
